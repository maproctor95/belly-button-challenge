### Purpose

I am utilizing javascript and html to analyze data from a dataset in order to get more detailed information about what the data shows.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* During this assignment I was able to complete all the goals and objectives for the assignment. I used what I have learned in the class to trouble shoot the code as I went through with javascript and made sure I was fully understanding what each part of my code did through labeling, so when an error popped up I knew how to approach the problem.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

* I think the biggest challenge for me was figuring out how to utilize the new language, javascript, to create the html page showing the graphs.
